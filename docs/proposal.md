## Background
### What is it about?
This project aims to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company, specifically understanding which customers are at risk of leaving the company's services.

### Why does it matter?
Customer churn is a critical issue in the telecom industry, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Predicting churn allows the company to take proactive steps to retain customers.

### Research Questions
- Can we accurately predict which customers are likely to churn?
- What are the key factors influencing customer churn in the telecom industry?
